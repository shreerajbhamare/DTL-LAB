Shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (bash).
